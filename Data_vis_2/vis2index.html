      <h1>Percentage of Non-white Oscars Best Director Nominees</h1>
      <h2>Percentage of Non-white Oscars Academy Award Best Director Nominees from the 1st award
        ceremony to the 94th</h2>
        <p1 class = "reveal">When looking at the demographics of the Oscars Best Director nominees throughout the years, one can in fact notice change——<strong>positive change.</strong></p1>
            <p2 class = "reveal">The scatter plot above with the percentages of non-white nominees from the 1st ceremony to the most recent 94th shows just that: improvement. From the firm 0% for 37 years to the 20% in 2022 and 40% the year before, one can’t deny that——though slight and slow——<strong>in recent years, the prestigious, white-dominated Academy has been working towards an increase in diversity.</strong></p2>
                <p3 class = "reveal">Perhaps, if these upward trends subsist, years from now, this dataset might look a lot more different—a lot more colorful. But until then, <strong>as of today, the film industry still remains a white-dominated industry.</strong></p3>
